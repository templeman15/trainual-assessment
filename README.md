Trainual Engineering Assessment

* To run specs run: 
`bundle exec rspec`

Wish list if time permitted:

- Rubocop adherence 
- Phone number validation
- Move formatting of date into helper
- Responsive design
- Display initial icon on which column is sorted by default
- Inserting record in correct position upon creation based off column sorting, right now it inserts it index 0 of the table

Suggestions

- Accessing instructions on engineering assessment through Trainual platform would have been cool
